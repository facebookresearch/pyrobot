**Note** This tutorial is tested to work only with Python2.7 version on PyRobot

## What is Sim2Real?

In this section we will train a simple RL policy which will learn inverse kinematics for the arm using RL(TD3). The input to the
RL agent is state(joint angles of arm) & goal location(x,y,z) and the control action is the change in each joint angles
to achieve the desired goal.

For TD3 implementation , we used the publicly available [code](https://github.com/sfujim/TD3).

Here is a demo video showing what one can accomplish through this tutorial.

## Installation

* Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source ~/pyenv_pyrobot/bin/activate
```

* Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install gym
pip install pybullet
```

* Start by either *training the agent from scratch* **or** *downloading pretrained model*

Train the agent (this might take around an hour)
```bash
cd ~/low_cost_ws/src/pyrobot/examples/sim2real
python train.py --exp_name expID01 --valid_goals --save_models
```

Download pretrained model
```bash
cd ~/low_cost_ws/src/pyrobot/examples/sim2real
wget -O log.zip https://www.dropbox.com/s/8cttp55odd7e79o/log.zip?dl=0
unzip log.zip
rm log.zip
```

* Launch the real robot (open a new terminalï¼‰

```bash
roslaunch locobot_control main.launch use_arm:=true
```

* Test the above trained policy on the real robot

```bash
source ~/pyenv_pyrobot/bin/activate
cd ~/low_cost_ws/src/pyrobot/examples/sim2real
python test.py --use_real_robot --valid_goals --directory ./log/expID01/pytorch_models --file_name LocoBotEnv-v0_0
```
