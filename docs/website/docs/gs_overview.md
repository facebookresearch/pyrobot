## What is PyRobot?

PyRobot is a Python package for benchmarking and running experiments in robot learning. The goal of this project is to abstract away the low-level controls for individual robots from the high-level motion generation and learning in an easy-to-use way. Using PyRobot will allow you to run robots without having to deal with the robot specific software along with enabling better comparisons.

## Supported Robots

Currently we support the following robots: 

- [LoCoBot](http://locobot.org/), a low cost mobile manipulator robot.
- [Sawyer](https://www.rethinkrobotics.com/sawyer/), a popular 7DoF manipulator.

If you would like to support your own robot with PyRobot, please follow the instructions [here](help_newrobot.md).

To get started, we will use the [LoCoBot](http://locobot.org/) robot as our working example. To get this robot, follow the instructions on the [LoCoBot](http://locobot.org/) webpage.

If you encounter any issue when using PyRobot, please check out the [FAQs](faq.md).
