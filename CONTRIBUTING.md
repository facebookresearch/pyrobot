Thank you for your interest in contributing to PyRobot! Your contributions will probably fall into two categories:

1. You want to implement a feature or bug-fix for an outstanding issue.
    - You can search for existing issues here: [https://github.com/facebookresearch/pyrobot/issues](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pyrobot/issues)
    - Pick an issue and comment on the task that you want to work on this feature.
    - If you need more context on a particular issue, please ask and we shall provide.
2. You would like to propose a new feature and implement it.
    - Post about your intended feature as a Github issue, and we shall discuss the design and
    implementation. Once we agree that the plan looks good, go ahead and implement it. Note that any core changes such as to the core PyRobot code or LoCoBot driver code will take a longer review process.

Once you finish implementing a feature or bug-fix, please send a Pull Request to
[https://github.com/facebookresearch/pyrobot](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pyrobot)

For more best practices on how to contribute, please see [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/docs/source/community/contribution_guide.rst) from the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) repo. The following document covers some of the more technical aspects of contributing to PyRobot.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Codebase Structure

## Pull Requests
Contributions will be managed through pull requests. This [article](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) is good resource for the pull request workflow.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Follow the steps in the section below section on [Testing](#testing)
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Please consider adding tutorials to better explain your feature. See section on [Tutorials](#tutorials)
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Testing
If you've added code that should be tested, please add tests. You can either add to existing test files or create new ones in the [tests](tests/) folder. The [tests/run_tests.py](tests/run_tests.py) script will launch and run the tests on a gazebo instance of the LoCoBot robot. Please also run existing tests and add new ones for the real robot (you can pass in *test_real* flag to the script). If you do not have any tests, please explain the reason.

## Tutorials
Please also consider adding tutorials if you are planning to submit a major feature, application or algorithm. Almost all the scripts in the [examples](examples) folder have their associated [tutorials](https://www.pyrobot.org/docs/overview) synced with [pyrobot.org](https://www.pyrobot.org/docs/overview). To add a new tutorial, first create a markdown file in [docs/website/docs](docs/website/docs) or add a symlink to wherever you have added it in the repo (we suggest having a single location for this markdown file for better management). If you want to add a tutorial, you also need to declare the markdown file *id* in [docs/website/website/sidebars.json](docs/website/website/sidebars.json) so that it shows up on the website.

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need
to do this once to work on any of Facebook's open source projects.

Complete your CLA here: <https://code.facebook.com/cla>

## Community
Please consider joining our forum (start a google group?)

## Coding Style

The python code uses [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) style. [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) will come in handy.
